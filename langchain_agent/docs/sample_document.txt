LangChain Agent Documentation

This is a sample document for testing the LangChain agent with retrieval capabilities.

Key Features:
- Document ingestion from PDF and TXT files
- ChromaDB vector store for semantic search
- Custom tools for conversation control
- Memory between conversation turns
- Comprehensive tracing with Noveum Trace

Custom Tools:
1. escalate_to_human - Escalates complex queries to human support
2. user_input - Gets additional input or clarification from the user
3. langchain_retriever - Searches the knowledge base

The agent uses a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) approach to handle user queries by:
1. Understanding the user's question
2. Deciding which tools to use
3. Executing the tools
4. Reasoning about the results
5. Providing a response or taking further action

This allows for complex multi-step reasoning and tool usage in a conversational format.
